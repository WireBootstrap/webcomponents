# WireBootstrap for Web Components
Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.

**WireBootstrap for Web Components** adds templates, two-way data binding, data services, and application event lifecycle hooks for building service-based data-driven applications using web components.

The solution also features a web component that turns any WireBootstrap component into a web component that can be used inside applications developed using web components.  With this component, there is no need for WireBootstrap component authors to create a separate web component version of their component.
